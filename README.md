## About Me

I am a developer with a passion for coding and reading. I first discovered my interest in code during my high school years, but it wasn't until December 2020 that I decided to pursue it seriously. This was sparked by my need to create a custom Discord bot that could fulfill specific requirements for my server. Since then, I have been honing my skills as a developer and exploring various programming languages and tools.
